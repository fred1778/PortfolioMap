# PortfolioMap
## A map to my portfolio of software engineering projects

## Mobile Development
I started my software development journey with iOS development in Objective-C as a teenager. I deployed my first app to the App Store in 2015 and have completed several more since then. I've kept my toes in the iOS waters over the years and I am experienced using Swift and SwiftUI. I built upon my experience with mobile app development for my final project for my MSc, in which I built a cross-platform app using Flutter.

| Name | Year | Description | Key Technologies  |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Easel](https://github.com/fred1778/Easel) | 2025 | A prototype art marketplace designed to help protect artists from generative AI. Designed and built as part of my MSc Computer Science final project at the University of Bristol | Languages: Dart (client app), Python (serverless functions) Flutter, Firebase | 
| [Ting Ting](https://github.com/fred1778/Ting-Ting) | 2014-15 | My first app, a very simple letter game, published on the App Store in early 2015 | Objective-C, UIKit | 
| [Art of Weather (original)](https://github.com/fred1778/ArtOfWeather) | 2021 | A weather app that matches the weather conditions to Open Access art from the Metropolitan Musuem of Art's API, published early 2021. The repo is the original version - I rebuilt a new version from the ground-up in 2025 (see below) | Swift, SwiftUI |
