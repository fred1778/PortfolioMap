## Mobile Development
I started my software development journey with iOS development in Objective-C as a teenager. I deployed my first app to the App Store in 2015 and have completed several more since then. I've kept my toes in the iOS waters over the years and I am experienced using Swift and SwiftUI. I built upon my experience with mobile app development for my final project for my MSc, in which I built a cross-platform app using Flutter.
